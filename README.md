# EM-Algorithm-Examples
Here are a couple examples of using the EM algorithm on statistical data. One example is a mixture of binomial distributions and the other is an exercise out of Casella Berger chapter 7.

## Mixture Distribution Problem
In this problem, we have a mixture of two binomial random variables with mixture parameter q. These binomials share a size, m, but they have success probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2$, respectively. The EM algorithm maximizes the posterior log likelihood given the previous iteration. (More description/explanation to come)

## Casella Berger Example
This is exercise 7.29 in Statistical Inference by Casella and Berger. Although the formulas are not exactly what they give in the example, they are derived here and converge to the true values of the parameters. (More description/explanation to come).
